# OCT MEMS Scanhead

As my second project in my master studies designed a 2d OCT MEMS Scanhead.

It contained three main tasks:
* Signal processing for drifing the MEMS
* Driver electronics design
* MCU Signal generation electronics design including Software

This repository contains the entier work including a documantaion in pdf format and the presentation as a video in german.
